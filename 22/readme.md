# Disclaimer

I am not solving part2 in generic case - it would require 
determining stitching rules for any covering of cube, that seems to be too much
of a hassle, although probably doable.

## Approach

Traveling over original map, adding "stitching" rules to change direction when traversing edges.

## Timing

0.25s
